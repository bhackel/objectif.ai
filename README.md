# objectif.ai
Program to rate pictures of dogs on a scale from 1 to 10

Intended to be imported as a package for use by other python programs, but I don't think I ever got that working properly.

A pretrained model is provided, but the data has been removed, and the model was weakly trained.

The face aligner is from Carykh [here](https://github.com/carykh/alignedCelebFaces/blob/master/code/anyFaceAligner.py)
